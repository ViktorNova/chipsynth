ChipSynth is a midi driven software synthetizer, mainly
inspired by SID, the C=64 sound chip.
It features two voices.

Each voice is composed by:
* an oscillator
* a waveform generator which can produce four types of waveform
  (triangular, sawtooth, pulse and noise) that can be combined
  together
* an envelope generator
* three filters (low pass, band pass and high pass) that can be
  selected together
* an effect stage whith chorus and echo

Four controls are avaiable for each voice:
* glissato - provides smooth varying between two notes
* arpeggio - an old style arpeggio effect when a chord is played
* hard sync - the oscillator is syncronized with the other voice
* ring modulation - when the triangle waveform is selected it is
  modulated by the other voice
